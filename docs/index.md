Ground is an open-source, map-first data collection platform built in collaboration with non-profits and international organizations with the goal of driving sustainability impact at scale. 

Ground incorporates best-in-class UX design and engineering to produce a tool which can be used by non-technical users with little to no special training. Our goal is to provide a "just right" data collection solution that meets the needs of community organizers, conservationists, humanitarian workers, and researchers. The platform consists of a web app for survey management, and an Android app for online/offline data collection. 

*Important: Ground is not a supported Google product. It is being developed on a best-effort basis.*
